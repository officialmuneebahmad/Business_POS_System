# Muneeb Business POS Pro Ultimate

A professional, high-performance, offline-resilient Point of Sale (POS) system designed for retail operations. 

Developed by **Muneeb Ahmad** from Pakistan, this system leverages modern vanilla frontend technologies and integrates with Google Sheets as a simplified, no-code backend engine for non-technical users, alongside Firebase for secure auth control.

* **Stock & Inventory Control:** Real-time inventory monitoring with unit configurations (`pc`, `kg`, `g`, `packet`, `box`, `liter`, etc.) and visual low-stock warnings based on custom alert thresholds.
* **Customer Directory & CRM:** Automated directory building grouping orders by phone number, displaying total items purchased, and offering a direct click-to-chat link for WhatsApp.

## 📊 Local Database Schema (localStorage)

The local state is cached in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `muneeb_pro_ultimate` to allow operations during offline network drops.

## ⚡ Google Apps Script Core Codebase

This script must be deployed in Google Drive as a **Web App** associated with your target Google Sheet. It manages reading from and writing rows directly to sheets named `Products`, `Stocks`, `Orders`, and `Customers`.

## 🔒 Security Configuration Details

### 1. Firebase Identity observer
Authentication checks restrict dashboard panel mounting unless credentials match registered store profiles:

### 2. Timed Debugger Guard (Anti-DevTools Loop)
To safeguard pricing schemas, margins, and script keys, `protect.js` implements timing-delta tests that trigger if code evaluation pauses (which is the case when developer tools windows are open):

## ⚙️ Deployment & Sync Guide

### Part A: Google Apps Script Web App Deployment
1. Open a Google Sheet and name it `POS Cloud DB`.
2. Go to **Extensions** > **Apps Script**.
3. Paste the Apps Script codebase from above, save, and click **Deploy** > **New Deployment**.
4. Select Type: **Web App**. Set access rules:
   * **Execute as:** `Me (your-email@gmail.com)`
   * **Who has access:** `Anyone` (necessary for webhook requests).
5. Click **Deploy**, accept authorization prompts, and copy the generated Web App URL.

### Part B: Client Configuration Setup
1. Launch the POS interface in your browser.
2. Sign in with your operator credentials.
3. Open the **Settings** tab (gear icon).
4. Paste the Web App URL in the **Google Script URL** input field.
5. Set your exchange rate (e.g. `278` PKR per USD) and click **Save Settings**.
6. Trigger the **Sync** button in the top navigation panel to sync database templates to Google Sheets.
